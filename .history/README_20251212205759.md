Files:
- `index.html` — main page (includes Bootstrap CDN)
- `styles.css` — custom styles
- `script.js` — logic and API calls


Instructions:
1. Save files in the same folder.
2. Make sure the hero background image is in the same path used in `styles.css` (or update the URL there). The project uses `/mnt/data/fba6707a-25e3-4c29-a25e-f34729ba74c3.png` by default — change to a relative path or hosted URL.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.


Deployment:
- Quick: push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages.
- Modern: deploy on Vercel/Netlify by dragging the folder into the dashboard.


Want more features? I can:
- Add categories, ratings, share buttons.
- Convert to React + Tailwind.
- Add animation, accessibility audits, or server-side deployment config.
